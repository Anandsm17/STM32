# STM32F407 Discovery Board â€“ Bare-Metal Device Driver Development

## Overview

This repository contains bare-metal device driver implementations for the STM32F407 Discovery board. The drivers are written from scratch in C and directly interact with the hardware registers without using any third-party HAL libraries or middleware. This project is intended to demonstrate low-level embedded system programming, register-level manipulation, and peripheral control.

## Target Hardware

- **Board**: STM32F407 Discovery
- **Microcontroller**: STM32F407VG (ARM Cortex-M4)

## Peripherals Implemented

### USART (Universal Synchronous/Asynchronous Receiver Transmitter)
###  SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
###  I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)
###  RCC (Reset and Clock Control)
